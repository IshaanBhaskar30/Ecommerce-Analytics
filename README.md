# 🛒 Python + SQL Ecommerce Analytics

This project demonstrates how to integrate SQL queries with Python to analyze an ecommerce dataset. Using MySQL as the database and Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn for analysis & visualization, the project explores customer, order, product, and sales trends.

## 🔹 Project Workflow

### 1.Database Connection

    - Connected to a MySQL database using Python (mysql.connector).

    - Queried multiple tables such as customers, orders, products, payments, sellers, order_items.

### 2.Business Queries Implemented

    - List all unique customer cities.

    - Count the number of orders placed in 2017.

    - Calculate total sales per category.

    - Find the percentage of installment payments.

    - Count customers from each state.

    - Orders per month in 2018.

    - Average number of products per order by city.

    - Revenue contribution by product category.

    - Correlation between product price and purchase frequency.

    - Seller-wise total revenue and ranking.

    - Moving average of order values per customer.

    - Cumulative monthly sales for each year.

    - Year-over-year sales growth.

    - Customer retention rate over time.

### 3.Python Integration

    - Retrieved query results into Pandas DataFrames.

    - Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to plot trends like revenue distribution, growth rate, and category performance.

### 🚀 Tech Stack

    - SQL (MySQL) → Data extraction and aggregation.

    - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data manipulation & visualization.

### 📈 Key Insights

    - Identified top-performing categories & sellers by revenue.

    - Analyzed customer distribution across cities and states.

    - Tracked monthly growth, retention, and order trends.

    - Derived business insights useful for ecommerce strategy.
